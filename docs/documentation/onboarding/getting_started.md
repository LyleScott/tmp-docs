# Getting Started

We've curated docs throughout this portal that touch on informational aspects of
Airspace along with some lower level developer facing docs. The following is an
ordered list to act as a quick-start guide to get educated on Airspace as well as how
to start exploring how an implementation might look.

1. [What is Airspace](/documentation/onboarding/what_is_airspace/) will teach you what
   Airspace was built for at a high level and dive into some fundamental project goals.
2. [Getting Started](/documentation/onboarding/getting_started/) will teach you what's
   needed to start integrating into Airspace.
3. Dive into the Technical topics section to pin-point specific feature or field docs.
4. [Get Help](/documentation/support/get_help/) will put you in touch with someone that
   can expedite your questions and verify your thinking or implementations.
5. Use [Feature Requests](/documentation/support/feature_requests/) to report features
  and tooling that would help you use or adopt Airspace.

> You don't have to do this alone! See our [Get Help](/documentation/support/get_help/)
