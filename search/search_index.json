Airspace is a REST API to support, manage, and automate the Video Technology Group's multi-CDN strategy and aims to provide a self-service and low-touch abstraction layer around several CDN vendors and additional tooling. These abstractions standardize CDN config creation, updates, and deletes to ensure that changes are repeatable and robustly propagated. Airspace's simplified REST API helps normalize configuration amongst several CDN vendors that all have different configuration patterns, terminology, or are missing parity features that you should be notified of instantly at configuration time rather stumbling into these constraints during hand-rolling CDN configs. Using Airspace to configure your streaming property takes advantage of the many pre-baked and proven configuration recipes that get bubbled up to the API as a simple flag of configuration stanza. Airspace also integrates into tooling to extend your CDN's feature set. For example, you may configure the entire Airspace property to also turn on Visor (another VTG VDE product) to capture and analyze a User configurable sample rate of your CDN logs so that you may query and alert on quality and delivery metrics from all CDNs through a single pane. Extend this even further by configuring the Airspace property with Touchstream and other 3rd party integrations. The idea is simple; tell Airspace about your business case, define some basic configuration parameters, and let Airspace take care of all the little configuration details in all the needed 3rd part system.","title":"Hi From Airspace!"},{"location":"documentation/#hi-from-airspace","text":"Airspace is a REST API to support, manage, and automate the Video Technology Group's multi-CDN strategy and aims to provide a self-service and low-touch abstraction layer around several CDN vendors and additional tooling.
